- Bugs:
  - Drag'n'drop not working on Android Firefox
  - Issues with virtual scroller
    - Navigate into 'Apps' (when only have a few), and back out; not all items drawn
    - disabled for now

- Browse
  - Fully handle SlimBrowse commands - e.g. buttons, radios, checkboxes
  - Before showing menu, check if item is in favourites - and adjust entries?
  - Grid view for albums, and artists (if using artist images). Other lists?

- Now playing
  - Show more info for desktop view. e.g. expand 3 tabs into 3 columns
  - Draw album cover as backdrop?

- Misc
  - Group management
    - Add create/delete/edit/list to JSON API in Groups plugin itself.
      ["groupmac", ["playergroup", 0, 100]] lists group details
      ["groupmac", ["playerpref", "playername", "X"]] sets group name
      ["groupmac", ["playerpref", "plugin.groups:members", ["maca", "macb"]]] sets group members
  - Smarter polling
    - Only poll status every 5 seconds
      - at start of song, and near end poll every (e.g.) 0.5 seconds
    - Create timer to advance song progress - re-adjust on each poll
    - or use ["time", "?"] to just obtain time position every second?
